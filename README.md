## API practice with the BetterDoctor API
---

#### Joe Pritchett

### Description

This project uses the BetterDoctor API to allow the user to search a keyword (medical conditions, doctor name, etc..) and view the first returned result.

There are two search forms, one that lets you search by doctor name, and another that lets you search by a keyword.

The name search API call uses the 'name' paramater of the 'doctor search' operation. It returns a list of doctors with the name you searched for.

The keyword search API call uses the 'query' paramater of the 'doctor search' operation. It returns a list of doctors that contain the keyword at some point in their information. Keep in mind that the displayed information is filtered down, so the keyword may not appear in the information you see.
